#### Task 1 – Creating a New Web Site Hosted in Windows Azure ####

1. Go to the [Windows Azure portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com/) and sign in using your **Microsoft Account** credentials associated with your subscription.

	![Sign in to Windows Azure Management portal](images/log-in-into-windows-azure-portal.png?raw=true "Sign in to Windows Azure Management portal")

	_Sign in to Windows Azure Management portal_

1. Click **New** at the bottom of the page.

	![Creating a new Web Site](images/creating-a-new-web-site.png?raw=true "Creating a new Web Site")

	_Creating a new Web site_

1. Click **Web Site** and then **Quick Create**.  Provide an available URL for the new Web Site and click **Create Web Site**.

	> **Note:** A Windows Azure Web Site is the host for a web application running in the cloud that you can control and manage. The Quick Create option allows you to deploy a completed web application to the Windows Azure Web Site from outside the portal. It does not include steps for setting up a database.

	![Creating a new Web Site using Quick Create ](images/creating-a-new-web-site-using-quick-create-op.png?raw=true "Creating a new Web Site using Quick Create")

	_Creating a new Web Site using Quick Create_

1.  Wait until the new web site is created.

	![Creating new web site status](images/creating-new-web-site-status.png?raw=true "Creating new web site status")

	_Creating new web site status_

1. Once the web site is created click the link under the **URL** column. Check that the new web site is working.

	_Web site running_

1. Go back to the portal and click the name of the web site under the **Name** column to display the management pages for the web site.

	![Opening the web site management pages](images/selecting-the-dashboard-tab.png?raw=true "Openining the web site management pages")

	_Opening the web site management pages_

1. In the **Dashboard** page, under the **quick glance** section, click the **Set up Git publishing** link.

	![Setting up Git Publishing](images/setting-up-git-publishing.png?raw=true "Setting up Git Publishing")

	_Setting up Git Publishing_

	> **Note:** Git is a free, open-source, distributed version control system that handles small to very large projects. After you set up Git publishing, each .Git push initiates a new deployment.

1. Wait a few seconds until the Git repository is ready.

	> **Tip:** After the Git repository is ready you will see a quick start page with the set of commands you need to execute for pushing your web application files to Windows Azure. 

	![Git repository created](images/git-repository-created.png?raw=true "Git repository created")

	_Git repository created_

1. Do not close the management portal.

<a name="Ex1Task2" />
#### Task 2 - Creating a New Node.js Web Application ####
 
1. Create a new **node** folder in your _C:\\_ drive, or in another location that can be easily accessed.

1. Create a new text file with a text editor and add the following code that will send the string *Hello World* to the browser. Save the file as **server.js** in the folder you created (in this case *C:\node*).
 
	```Javascript
	var http = require('http');
	var port = process.env.port || 1337;
	http.createServer(function (req, res) {
					  res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
					  res.end('Hello World\n');
	}).listen(port);
	```
 
1. Create a new text file with a text editor and add the following code. Save the file as **package.json** in the **node** folder.
 
	```Json
	{
	  "name": "HelloWorld",
	  "version": "0.0.1",
	  "description": "",
	  "main": "./server.js",
	  "engines": { "node": ">= 0.6.0" }
	}
	```

	>**Note:** The package.json file tells the Node.js package manager (npm) how your package is structured, and which are the module dependencies. As this application is very simple it does not require dependencies, but in more complex apps you will probably need to specify a "dependencies" property. When publishing apps with Git, Windows Azure platform automatically installs all the dependencies declared in this file.
 
1. Create another text file with a text editor and add the following code. Save the file as **web.config** in your web site folder (in this case *C:\node*). This configuration indicates that the **server.js** file is a Node.js application
to be handled by the iisnode module.
 
	> **Note:** The [iisnode](https://github.com/tjanczuk/iisnode) project provides a native IIS 7.x module that allows hosting of node.js applications in IIS 7.x and IIS 7.x Express (WebMatrix).

	```XML
	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
	<configuration>
		<system.webServer>
			  <modules runAllManagedModulesForAllRequests="false" />

			  <!-- indicates that the server.js file is a node.js application 
				to be handled by the iisnode module -->
			  <handlers>
				<add name="iisnode" path="server.js" verb="*" modules="iisnode" />
			  </handlers>
			  <rewrite>
				<rules>
				  <clear />
				  <rule name="app" enabled="true" patternSyntax="ECMAScript" stopProcessing="true">
					<match url="server\.js.+" negate="true" />
					<conditions logicalGrouping="MatchAll" trackAllCaptures="false" />
					<action type="Rewrite" url="server.js" />
				  </rule>
				</rules>
			  </rewrite>
		</system.webServer>
	</configuration>
	```

#### Task 3 – Publishing the Node.js Application using Git####

1. Go back to the Windows Azure Management Portal. Open the site's **Dashboard** and under the **quick glance** section, copy the **Git Clone Url** value.

	![Git Clone Url](images/git-clone-url.png?raw=true)

	_Copying the Git Clone Url_

1. In order to publish your local files, open a **Git BASH** console, CD into your application folder (in this case *C:\node*) and run the following commands.

	```CommandPrompt
	git init
	git add .
	git commit -m "initial commit"
	```

	> **Note:** You can learn more about Git commands in the project documentation http://git-scm.com/documentation.

1. To add the remote Windows Azure repository and push the files, run the following commands. Replace the _{Git Clone Url}_ placeholder with the value obtained from the portal.

	```CommandPrompt
	git remote add azure {Git Clone Url}
	git push azure master
	```

1. Enter the deployment credentials when prompted.

	> **Note:** Deployment credentials are other than the Microsoft Account associated with your Windows Azure subscription and are valid for use with all Windows Azure web sites associated with your subscription. If you don't know your deployment credentials you can easily reset them using the management portal. Open the web site's **Dashboard** page and click the **Reset deployment credentials** link. Provide a new password and click Ok.
	>
	>![Resetting the deployment credentials](images/setting-the-username-and-password.png?raw=true "Resetting the deployment credentials")

### Exercise 2: Building and Publishing a Node.js Web Site using the Command-Line Tools ###

In this exercise, you will learn how to manage web sites using the Windows Azure Command-Line Tools. 

>**Note:** In the prerequisites section of this lab you will find the instructions to install the Command-Line Tools.

1. Open a Command Prompt with administrator privileges and execute the following command to download your account _publish profile_ file. A new browser window will pop up and you must login using your **Microsoft Account** credentials. 
    
    Once logged in, save the publish profile file in a known location (for example, 'C:\\')

	```CommandPrompt
	azure account download
	```

	![Downloading the account publish profile](images/download-publishsettings.png?raw=true "Downloading the account publish profile")

	_Downloading the account publish profile_

1. Go back to the Command Prompt and import the file downloaded in the step above by running the following command, specifying the publish profile file location in the _{publish_profile_file}_ placeholder (in this case *'C:\\'*).

	```CommandPrompt
	azure account import {publish_profile_file}
	```

1. Execute [Task 2 from Exercise 1](#Ex1Task2) to create a Node.js site, but place the files in a different folder than exercise 1 (for example *C:\NodeCLI*).

1. Open a Windows Command Prompt and CD to the folder where you placed the site (in this case *C:\NodeCLI*).

1. Run the following command to create the Windows Azure hosted site.

	```CommandPrompt
	azure site create --git
	```

	Provide a site name when prompted, for example, _NodeCLI_. Then select a region and proceed.

	![Creating a new Web Site using the Command-Line Tools](images/new-web-site-cli.png?raw=true "Creating a new Web Site using the Command-Line Tools")

	_Creating a new Web Site using the Command-Line Tools_

	> **Note:** By specifying **--git** when running the command **site create** you don't need to run additional commands to initialize the Git repository or add the git remote, since these two tasks will be done automatically by the command line tools.

1. Now you will add the current files to the Git repository and push them. To do this, go back to the command prompt and execute the following commands. When prompted, provide your deployment credentials.

	```CommandPrompt
	git add .
	git commit -m "initial commit"
	git push azure master
	```
	![Pushing the site files](images/push-site.png?raw=true "Pushing the site files")

	_Pushing the site files_

	> **Note:** Deployment credentials are other than the Microsoft Account associated with your Windows Azure subscription and are valid for use with all Windows Azure web sites associated with your subscription. If you don't know your deployment credentials you can easily reset them using the management portal. Open the web site's **Dashboard** page and click the **Reset deployment credentials** link. Provide a new password and click Ok.
	>
	>![Resetting the deployment credentials](images/reset-credentials-cli.png?raw=true "Resetting the deployment credentials")
	>
	>_Resetting the deployment credentials_

1. Let's check that the publishing was successful. Run the following command to open the site in the Windows Azure Management portal and provide your Microsoft Account credentials associated with the subscription to sign in.

	```CommandPrompt
	azure site portal
	```
	In the Windows Azure portal, click your site in the Web Site list and open the **Deployments** page of the site. Check out the latest deployment.

	![Web Site deployments](images/site-deployments.png?raw=true "Web Site deployments")

	_Web Site deployments_

1. Now execute the following command to browse to the web site and make sure it runs successfully.

	```CommandPrompt
	azure site browse
	```

	![Published web site](images/website-working-cli.png?raw=true "Published web site")
